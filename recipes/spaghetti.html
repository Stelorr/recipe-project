    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Basil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bread Crumbs</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan Cheese</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Marinara Sauce</strong></li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>    
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Preheat</strong> - Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
        <li> <strong>Egg and Meat Dance</strong> - In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water. Add the meat, breadcrumbs and cheese and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li> <strong>Rollin'</strong> - Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the baking sheet from oven and use a metal spatula to turn the meatballs.</li>
        <li> <strong>Hey Marinara</strong> - In the meantime, bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Taste it and adjust the seasoning if necessary (I usually add a healthy pinch of sugar and some freshly ground black pepper). Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, leaving the fat behind. Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Final Step</strong> - While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs.</li>
    </ol>
