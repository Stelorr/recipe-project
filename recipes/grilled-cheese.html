    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It’s incredibly simple, but it yields an undeniably crave-able sandwich.</p>
        <p>This grilled cheese is crisp and golden on the outside and deliciously melty in the middle (see that cheese pull up there?!).</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Good Bread</strong> – My preferred type of bread for this recipe is sourdough, because I love the tang it adds to the sandwich.</li>
            <li> <strong>Mayonnaise</strong> – For the outside of the bread! It helps it cook up with a crisp, beautifully browned exterior.</li>
            <li> <strong>Dijon mustard</strong> – It’s not totally traditional, but it’s SO delicious, adding subtle tangy flavor.</li>
            <li> <strong>Butter</strong> – For the pan.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cheese</strong> - I love to use a combo of two different cheeses to give the sandwich a richer taste.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Spread mayo on bread.</strong> Not butter! The mayo helps the bread brown insanely well in the skillet, creating a mouthwatering crunch when you bite into the sandwich.</li>
            <li> <strong>Add grated cheese.</strong> I find that grated cheese melts more evenly than a slice of cheese does.</li>
            <li> <strong>Choose the right skillet.</strong> We like to use cast-iron because it creates gorgeous browning on the outside of the sandwich.</li>
            <li> <strong>Go low and slow.</strong> I don’t raise my heat any higher than medium-low. If the pan gets too hot, the bread will burn before the cheese melts.</li>
            <li> <strong>Cover the pan.</strong> Add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Then, add the sandwich, and COVER the skillet.</li>
            <li> <strong>Adjust the heat as needed.</strong> Lower it if the bread is browning too quickly!</li>

        </ol>
